## Description

In this week's project, I was given some code to refactor and clean up to the following specs:

#### User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Mock-Up

**Note**: This layout is designed for "desktop", so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the Mock-Up when viewed at a resolution smaller than 768px. In future lessons, you will learn how to make elements "responsive" so that your web application is optimized for any screen size.

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

## Result

* Updating the code in the HTML and the CSS files, I was able to use simplification and semantic code without affecting the existing webpage or it's functionality.
